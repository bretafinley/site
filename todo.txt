think about adding "image" metadata to posts, could use this for a time-line style header or something
    images are handled really strangely in gatsby
add component for comments
add content to about page
clean up css and add preprocessor
make "recent posts" cards that have a bit more information
add on hover style for side list items, maybe invert the color scheme
