think about adding "image" metadata to posts, could use this for a time-line style header or something
    images are handled really strangely in gatsby
add component for comments
make "recent posts" cards that have a bit more information
figure out image hosting
put pictures in their own "card" at the top of posts, about needs one
still need to add resume
clean up margin values
work on readme
