Take me to your leader! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Who are you, my warranty?! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

I'm a thing. Daylight and everything. Shut up and take my money! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. You can see how I lived before I met you.

Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Leela's gonna kill me. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?

Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Look, last night was a mistake. Tell them I hate them. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

Throw her in the brig. Kids have names? With gusto. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

No. We're on the top. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! How much did you make me? Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Who are those horrible orange men? Say it in Russian! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! It doesn't look so shiny to me. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
